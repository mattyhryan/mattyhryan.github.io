## Personal

I grew up in Franklin, Massachusetts, home of America's first public library, a train line that runs to Boston, and not a whole lot else. 

After graduating from high school, I fortunate to have the opportunity to leave my small town and headed off to study at the University of Connecticut. Upon arrival, I realized I had accidentally moved to an even smaller, more rural town - complete with cows and sheep to boot.

Since then, I've spent time learning Portuguese while living in Brazil, learning Spanish while living in Argentina, and learning not to block the telly in the pub when the football/rugby match is on while living in the UK.

In my free time, you'll probably find watching a film, cooking something new, listening to a podcast, or lurking on twitter. Sometimes all at once.
