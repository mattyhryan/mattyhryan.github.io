I am a second year PhD student in Organisational Behaviour at London Business School. My research focuses on how formal organizational hierarchies, informal social hierarchies, and morality affect how we think, behave, and interact with others.

Prior to starting my PhD, I received my MSc in Behavioural Science from Durham University, having previously completed an MSc in Education Research and a dual BA in Economics and English. I have previously worked with [Dr. Jared Curhan](http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/) as a research assistant in the [MIT Behavioral Research Lab](https://brl.mit.edu/) at the MIT Sloan School of Management, as the Research Technician in the [Ross Behavioral Lab](https://cores.research.umich.edu/core/ross-behavioral-lab/) at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, and with [Dr. Erika Kirgios](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/k/erika-kirgios) as a research assistant at Chicago Booth.
 
## Research Interests

*Social Hierarchies, Organizational Hierarchies, & Morality*

My research interests lie at the intersection of social/organizational psychology, organizational design, and organizational behavior and management. I am broadly interested in examining the social and organizational consequences of hierarchies and morality on how we perceive ourselves and evaluate the individuals and groups around us.

To understand how an individual’s position in power and status hierarchies affect their social cognition, emotions, behaviors, and perceptions of others my research draws on social psychological and evolutionary theories. I am also interested in the intersection between power, status, and leadership and am particularly keen to explore how these three concepts emerge at the micro-level across different hierarchical contexts and how the psychological experience of these three concepts differ.

In the moral domain, I am interested in how we respond to positive and negative deviant behaviors, the factors that motivate norm deviance and adherence, and the role of morality in impression formation/updating processes and in shaping our categorizations and judgements of others.

On the more applied end, I am interested in using the behavioral insights generated from this theoretical research to design interventions aimed at promoting inclusivity, diversity, and pro-social behaviors and reducing prejudicial and discriminatory behaviors. For instance, insights from the stream of research on social hierarchies and influence could be applied to help to non-stereotypical leadership candidates attain and maintain higher hierarchical positions. 

If you are interested in working together (or simply chatting), please feel free to get in touch.

## Personal

I grew up in Franklin, Massachusetts, home of America's first public library, a commuter train that runs to Boston, and not much else. 

After graduating from high school, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to leave my small town and headed off to study at the University of Connecticut. Upon arrival, I realized I had accidentally moved to an even smaller, more rural town - complete with cows and sheep to boot!

Since then, I've spent time learning Portuguese while living in Brazil, learning Spanish while living in Argentina, and learning not to block the telly in the pub when the football is on while living in the UK (in addition to completing two postgraduate programs and starting a third).

In my free time, you'll probably find me at the cinema, sipping espresso, or running through the streets of London.
