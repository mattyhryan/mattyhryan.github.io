Recently, I completed my Master of Science in Behavioral Science at Durham University, having previously completed an MSc in Education Research and a dual BA in Economics and English. Since then, I ran an in-person study as an RA at the [MIT Behavioral Research Lab](https://brl.mit.edu/) and am currently writing as a contributor for [ScienceForWork](https://scienceforwork.com/). 

## Research Interests

*Social Cognition & Perception, Social Hierarchies, Morality*

My research interests lie at the intersection of social/organizational psychology and behavioral science. From a basic science perspective, I am interested in examining the effects of social hierarchies and morality on how we perceive ourselves and evaluate others. On the more applied end, I am interested in using the behavioral insights gained from this theoretical research to design interventions aimed at reducing discrimination and promoting inclusivity and pro-social behaviors. 

To understand how individuals' social cognition, emotions, and behaviors are affected by their position in power and status hierarchies, my research draws on social psychological and evolutionary theories. I am also interested in how hierarchies are formed and how they shape social interactions.

In the moral domain, I am interested in how we respond to positive and negative deviant behaviors, the factors that motivate norm deviance and adherence, and the role of morality in impression formation and social categorization processes.

If you are interested in working together (or simply chatting), please feel free to get in touch.

## Personal

I grew up in Franklin, Massachusetts, home of America's first public library, a commuter train that runs to Boston, and not a whole lot else. 

After graduating from high school, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to leave my small town and headed off to study at the University of Connecticut. Upon arrival, I realized I had accidentally moved to an even smaller, more rural town - complete with cows and sheep to boot!

Since then, I've spent time learning Portuguese while living in Brazil, learning Spanish while living in Argentina, and learning not to block the telly in the pub when the football/rugby match is on while living in the UK (in addition to completing two postgraduate programs).

In my free time, you'll probably find me watching a film, cooking something new, listening to a podcast, or lurking on twitter - sometimes, all at once.
